# Generic Linked List Implementation

This project is a custom implementation of a generic linked list data structure in Java. It provides basic functionality for adding and removing elements from the list, as well as retrieving the head and tail of the list.

## Features

- Implements a generic linked list that can store elements of any type.
- Supports adding elements to the end of the list.
- Allows removing elements from the beginning of the list.
- Provides methods to retrieve the head and tail of the list.
- Includes a custom exception class for handling empty list scenarios.
- Demonstrates usage of the linked list with a Person class that implements the Comparable interface.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generic-linked-list.git`
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Explore the different classes and their implementations:
   - `LinkedList.java`: The main linked list class that provides the core functionality.
   - `ListCell.java`: Represents a single cell in the linked list, containing the cell content and a reference to the next cell.
   - `EmptyListException.java`: A custom exception class for handling empty list scenarios.
   - `Person.java`: An example class that represents a person with a name, ID, and birth year. It implements the Comparable interface for comparison based on birth year.
   - `Main.java`: The entry point of the program that demonstrates the usage of the linked list and its methods.
4. Run the `Main.java` class to see the linked list in action.
